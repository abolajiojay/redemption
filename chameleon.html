 <h1 style="text-align: center;"> Fun Facts About Chameleons!!!</h1>    
<p>
    1. The biggest mistake people make about chameleons
    A lot of people think chameleons change their colour based on their surroundings – sort of like camouflage.
     However, this isn’t true. <br>
     <br>
    
    Chameleons actually change their colour due to a number of different factors,
     including their mood, changes in light or temperature, or the humidity of their environment. <br>
    
    Different chameleons will also have different colours.
     For instance, more dominant, attractive males will have brighter colours,
      and submissive males may be darker browns and greys.
       Women will change their colours based on whether they want to accept or reject a suitor. <br>
    
    So if you can’t find a chameleon because it is blending into its surroundings,
     just turn the lights on and you’ll be able to find it! (It might have been useful 
     to have the lights on in the first place, though.) <br>
     <br>
     2. Chameleons have eyes in the backs of their heads
Well, not literally – but they can move their eyes separately,
 with each eye having a field of 180 degrees. This means they can see 360 degrees if they need to! 

This is useful because it means they can see predators coming from behind them, 
 giving them a chance to scarper if they’re about to get caught. <br>

Compare this to humans: our eyes are on the front of our heads, giving us a narrower
 field of vision, but better perception of depth. This singles us out as more predatory
  than our chameleon friends – though as we’ll see, they also have vision excellently
   adapted to being a predator. <br>

Sometimes it might be useful to have 360-degree vision, though – nobody likes being sneaked up on! <br>
 <br>
<br>
3.  Chameleons like it hot
59 unique species of chameleon live on the island of Madagascar and are found nowhere else. 
This is over a quarter of the world’s 202 species.


This might not come as a surprise to those who know that 90% of the wildlife found on Madagascar 
is found nowhere else on Earth!

Aside from this, chameleons like to live in warm, tropical regions. Don’t we all?
 You can find them predominantly on the mainland of sub-Saharan Africa. <br> <br>

 4. Most chameleons eat on things you wouldn’t want to find on your dinner plate
The majority of chameleons survive by eating insects, and some complement this diet by
 feeding on foliage and fruits. Some larger species eat up to 50 large crickets every day. <br>

Others may be a little more carnivorous, and feast on small birds and even other, smaller chameleons. <br>

So while it might be useful having a tongue that can shoot out and grab cookies,
 you probably won’t want to use it to eat a chameleon’s diet. <br> <br>


5. We all know that guy who likes to show off…

Like most animals, male and female chameleons look differently.
 Though not particularly social animals, males usually have horns and spikes, while females don’t. <br>


Not just for show, 
though, these bodily decorations
 are used when a male has to protect its territory from another chameleon,
  and some of the spikes can help them blend into their environment. <br>
